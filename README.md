gpn-subtitles
=============

coordination repository for subtitling video recordings from the GPN


Workflow
--------

There's one issue for every talk that was at the gpn13. If you want to work on subtitling a talk in the original language, translate an existing subtitle into another language or creating a translated subtitle, please leave a note in the corresponding issue. If you don't have and don't want to get a github account, feel free to send queries to timo+gpn-subtitles@wakelift.de

Please name the subtitle files $basename-of-video-file.$language.srt

A decent subtitle editor for creating new subtitles from scratch is aegisub; just make sure to save often!

Submitting
----------

You can fork this repository and send a pull request via github, ask for commit rights in one of our issues or send git format-patch'd commits to timo+gpn-subtitles@wakelift.de
